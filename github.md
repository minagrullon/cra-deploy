## main

       \_______________/
       branch to do some work

       How do I create a branch? use the folowing command:
       -checkout tells us to go to a different place
       - '-b' is syaing create a new branch
       git checkout -b <name of your branch>

       git checkout- b JD

       To combine add and commit use :
       git commit -am 'message'

       To see all branches:
       git branch
       hit Q when you are done viewing the branches

       To push to a branch:
       git push origin <branch name>


       git checkout <branch nanem> without the b allows you to look

       git checkout -  (takes you to the last branch you were on)

       git pull origin main -> do this after you merge on GitHub and before you add anything else to your main branch
